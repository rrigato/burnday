How is the fuel burning status calculated?
We take the air quality index for a given zip code to calculate the fine and coarse particulate matter for the provided zip code. The burn status is then calculated based on local ordinances/regulations.

Why did the zip code I provide result in an air quality status being returned?
Burning restriction thresholds differ across local municipalities, at this time we do not have specific burning regulations for that zip code. Please check back in the future as we are adding new zip codes with each feature release.
